# Next.js 15: Missing return statement in page component causes error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js 15 applications where a page component is missing a return statement.  This results in a runtime error.

## Bug Report
The `pages/about.js` file is missing a `return` statement in the `About` component.  This causes Next.js to throw an error because it doesn't know what to render.

## Solution
The solution involves adding a `return` statement to the `About` component, even if it's just returning null.

## How to reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to `/about` in your browser. You should see the error.
5. Replace `pages/about.js` with `pages/aboutSolution.js`. 
6. Refresh the browser. The error should be resolved.
